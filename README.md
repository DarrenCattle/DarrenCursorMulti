Kinect + Arduino feature enabled WPF C# Application

These are the parameters that need to be enabled once you have connected a Microsoft Kinect to your computer.
InitializeComponent and Loaded are disabled by default as mouse input is also acceptable.
Kinect is treated as a mouse for this application but sliders, buttons, and interfaces can be added via normal Kinect implementation.
```
//InitializeComponent();
//Loaded += OnLoaded;
```
